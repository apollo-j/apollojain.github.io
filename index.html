                <p>I'm an aspiring software developer studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in the application of my skills in alternative energy, education technology, and financial services. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, reading books, lifting weights, and making music.</p>
                <p>Of course, another thing I love to do in my free time is coding. You can see some of my work under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. I will also be eventually writing some tutorials.</p>
                <p>Want to get into contact with me? Feel free to send an <a href="mailto:apollojain@gmail.com">email</a> to apollojain@gmail.com! I'd love to sit down for some coffee and discuss anything from algorithmic trading to dank memes. Oh, and feel free to check out my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>!
