                <p>I'm an aspiring software developer studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in the application of my skills in alternative energy, healthcare, and educational technology.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I've gotten the opportunity to do a lot of cool stuff, including co-founding my university's <a href="http://rab.berkeley.edu">Robotics Club</a>, co-founding a <a href="http://www.recharge-initiative.org">non-profit</a> that teaches refugees how to code, and working at awesome companies like Tesla and Salesforce. In my free time, I enjoy cooking desserts, reading books, lifting weights, and making music.</p>
                <p>Of course, another thing I love to do in my free time is coding. You can see some of my work under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. I will also be eventually writing some tutorials.</p>
                <p>Want to get into contact with me? Feel free to send an <a href="mailto:apollojain@gmail.com">email</a> to apollojain@gmail.com! I'd love to sit down for some coffee and discuss anything from algorithmic trading to dank memes. Oh, and feel free to check out my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>!
