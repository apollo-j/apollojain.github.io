After starting a weightligting program called Starting Strength, I realized that I could use a little bit of help in making sure my weightlifting form was correct, my diet was good, and my weights were progressing. So, I decided to create this app! It has videos of each exercise in the program, diet advice, and even a weight tracker for each exercise based on date. I coded it using the Android SDK using Java, XML, and SQL. It has since been downloaded over 5000 times.
