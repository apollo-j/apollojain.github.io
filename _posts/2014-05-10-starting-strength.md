After starting a weightligting program called Starting Strength, I realized that I could use a little bit of help in making sure my weightlifting form was correct, my diet was good, and my weights were progressing. So, I decided to create this app! It has videos of each exercise in the program, diet advice, and even a weight tracker for each exercise based on date. I coded it using the Android SDK using Java, XML, and SQL. Although it was not my best project, it was by far the most prolific, recieving over 5000 downloads before it was taken down for some sort of Copyright violation with some app with a similar name.
