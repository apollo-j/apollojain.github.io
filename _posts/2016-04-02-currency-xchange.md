A lot of folks talk about how they use Algorithmic Trading in Foreign Exchange. I like reading about finance and messing with code, so I figure I'd try my hand at maximizing the exchange rates between two currencies and, in addition, whether you can actually get more money by converting from one currency back to the original currency. So, I build a little algorithm using a few GET requests and a bit of python code. Built using Flask and Graphviz.
