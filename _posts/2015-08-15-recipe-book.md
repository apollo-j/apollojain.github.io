In order to create this application, I first scraped a couple of recipes off of bigoven.com using their API and saved them to my website. I then wrote an app with a Tinder-like interface to actually go through the recipes. Like a recipe? Hit the check mark or swipe right. You'll then be able to actually see the recipe. Don't like it? Hit the "x" button or swipe left. Created using Java and XML using the Android SDK.
