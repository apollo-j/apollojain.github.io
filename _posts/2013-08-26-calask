In Summer of 2013, in order to address repeatedly asked questions in the Berkeley Class of 2017 Community, I founded Berkeley FAQs, which provided answers to students' common queries about UC Berkeley. I allowed for Berkeley FAQs to be incorporated into the CalAsk website, gathered a number of Berkeley students to contribute to both Berkeley FAQs and CalAsk and helped to create and manage the project's Facebook Page. Created in HTML and CSS.
