                                    <p>After starting a weightligting program called Starting Strength, I realized that I could use a little bit of help in making sure my weightlifting form was correct, my diet was good, and my weights were progressing. So, I decided to create this app! It has videos of each exercise in the program, diet advice, and even a weight tracker for each exercise based on date. I coded it using the Android SDK using Java, XML, and SQL. Although it was not my best project, it was by far the most prolific, recieving over 5000 downloads before it was taken down for some sort of Copyright violation with some app with a similar name.</p>

                            <p>A lot of folks talk about how they use Algorithmic Trading in Foreign Exchange. I like reading about finance and messing with code, so I figure I’d try my hand at maximizing the exchange rates between two currencies and, in addition, whether you can actually get more money by converting from one currency back to the original currency. So, I build a little algorithm using a few GET requests and a bit of python code. Built using Flask and Graphviz.</p>

                            <p>In July of 2014, a team of four (Alex Kang, Ryan Hsu, and Richie Farman) and I developed an Android app that allows you to schedule SMS messages in order to remind friends to do certain things at a particular time. We placed in the top 3 in the H@B ABC Hackathon.</p>

                            <p>In response to a high number of repeated questions on Berkeley/’s Course Advice Page, I created this small questionaire in order to help students decide what classes to take. It lets students know if their schedules are easy, moderate, or difficult. It is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

                            <p>After starting a weightligting program called Starting Strength, I realized that I could use a little bit of help in making sure my weightlifting form was correct, my diet was good, and my weights were progressing. So, I decided to create this app! It has videos of each exercise in the program, diet advice, and even a weight tracker for each exercise based on date. I coded it using the Android SDK using Java, XML, and SQL. Although it was not my best project, it was by far the most prolific, recieving over 5000 downloads before it was taken down for some sort of Copyright violation with some app with a similar name.</p>

                            <p>In Summer of 2013, in order to address repeatedly asked questions in the Berkeley Class of 2017 Community, I founded Berkeley FAQs, which provided answers to students’ common queries about UC Berkeley. I allowed for Berkeley FAQs to be incorporated into the CalAsk website, gathered a number of Berkeley students to contribute to both Berkeley FAQs and CalAsk and helped to create and manage the project’s Facebook Page. Created in HTML and CSS.</p>
